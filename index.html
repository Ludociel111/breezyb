            <p>I thank God for your 17 amazing years 🎉🎉 (they grow up so fast 🤧🤧). I pray that God fulfills all your heart’s desires 🙏💖 and that you always keep that beautiful smile on your face 🤭 (I’ve always loved your smile, by the way 🙈💜).</p>
            <img src="images/image2.jpg" alt="Celebration Image 2">
            <p>You've always been someone I can't seem to run from 😹💜. I still remember the first day we spoke in SS1 during break time 💜; you seemed cool and special at that moment ✨, and I wasn't wrong 🙂. I thank God for bringing you into my life; you are genuinely one of my most cherished and valuable friends 🥹💜 (don't tell Desmond, please 😹💜—I wouldn't want him getting jealous 😹💔).</p>
            <img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="Celebration Image 3">
            <p>You’ve helped me in more ways than you’ll ever know 💡💪. From your sometimes terribly good advice 🎓, to your laughter 😆, to just being there when I need someone to talk to 🤗💜. I know I haven’t always been the perfect friend 🙈🙈, and I’ve made mistakes 😹💔. But there’s something about you that makes me want to be a better person and improve my life as a whole 🌟✨.</p>
            <img src="images/image4.jpg" alt="Celebration Image 4">
            <p>You always talk about not being smart 🤨, and even though you sometimes doubt yourself academically 😹, you're smart in so many other ways that truly matter (don't ask me how 🤐🤐). You're ambitious 💼, curious 👀, smart 🤓, gorgeous 💃💜, kind 🥰, and open 🌈. My ideal spec 💯😹🌚💜.</p>
            <img src="images/image5.jpg" alt="Celebration Image 5">
            <p>I sometimes wonder how many mistakes a person can make in a friendship before the other person walks away 🤷. I guess we’ll never know, because you’ve given me more chances than I can count 🤲💜—more than I deserve—and you’ve never turned your back on me 🫂💜. The fact that we’re still friends just shows how awesome you are 🤩🙌. Thank you for never giving up on me 🥹💜, even when it wasn’t easy 🥲. You’ve taught me so much about persistence and giving people chances ♻️, and it’s inspired me to never give up on others when I remember that you never gave up on me 💜.</p>
            <img src="images/image6.jpg" alt="Celebration Image 6">
            <p>THANK YOU for being my friend, Brianna. You're truly special! I know I don’t say it enough, but I appreciate you and everything you’ve done for me 💕💜🙌. You’ve become more than a friend—you’re like a sister 💝💜, if I’m allowed to say that. And no matter what happens, I’ve always got your back 💪💜, just like you’ve always had mine 🤝💜.</p>
            <img src="images/image7.jpg" alt="Celebration Image 7">
            <p>So, happy birthday once again 🎂🎁🎈! Go out and grace the world with your amazing presence 💫. Today’s your day 🌟—so make the most of it! 🦵😆</p>
            <p>P.S.: (Sorry for the long letter 😅, feels like you’re reading an IHS essay, right? 😹💜. By the way, I started writing this on 18/09/2024 🤓. Don’t think I’m weird 😹💜. I just wanted it to be perfect for someone special 🌚💜. In case you’re wondering, I used ChatGPT to help with grammar checks and punctuation, but I wrote everything myself 💜).</p>
