            <p>I thank God for your 17 amazing years 🎉🎉 (it feels like it was just yesterday we were still kids 🤧🤧).I pray for more money for you, youll be successful just like we used to talk about. I pray that God fulfills all your heart’s desires 🙏💖 and that you never lose that beautiful smile 🤭.(by the way, I’ve always loved your smile, incase I've never told you before🙈💜.</p>

            <img src="IMG-20240918-WA0010.jpg" alt="Celebration Image 2">
            <p>I still vividly remember the first time we spoke in SS1 during break time 💜 I was sitting at your back and you were eating yam in my front, even then, there was something about you that I just liked🤭, and I knew right away you were someone special✨. I wasn’t wrong 🙂. I’m so grateful that God brought you into my life, and I honestly can’t imagine you not being here, now that you are. You’ve become one of my most cherished and valuable friends 🥹💜 (but please, don’t tell Desmond 😹💜—I’d hate to see him get jealous 😹💔).</p>

            <img src="IMG-20240918-WA0013.jpg" alt="Celebration Image 3">
            <p>Over the years, you’ve helped me in more ways than you’ll ever know 💡💪. Whether it's your spot-on advice 🎓, your beautiful laughter 😆, or just being there when I needed someone to talk to 🤗💜, you’ve always been a constant. I know I haven’t always been the perfect friend 🙈🙈, and I’ve made a hell of mistakes 😹💔. But knowing what you'd do for me makes me want to be a better person, and honestly, you inspire me to improve in a handful of ways 🌟✨.</p>

            <img src="IMG-20240918-WA0012.jpg" alt="Celebration Image 4">
            <p>I know you sometimes feel like you’re not that smart 😶😶, but let me just say—you couldn’t be more wrong. Even if academics aren’t your thing all the time 😹, you’re smart in so many other ways that truly matter. You’re ambitious 💼, curious 👀, wise 🤓, gorgeous 💃💜, and kind 🥰—everything that truly counts. If I had to describe my ideal girl, it would be someone just like you 💯😹🌚💜.</p>

            <img src="IMG-20240918-WA0011.jpg" alt="Celebration Image 5">
            <p>Sometimes I wonder how many mistakes one person can make before the other finally walks away 🤷. But clearly, we’ll never find out because you’ve always given me more chances than I deserve 🤲💜. You’ve stood by me even when you had enough reason to leave, and that says so much about the incredible person you are. You’ve taught me the value of persistence and forgiveness ♻️, and every time I think of how you've never given up on me, it reminds me to do the same for others 💜.</p>

            <img src="IMG-20240918-WA0014.jpg" alt="Celebration Image 6">
            <p>So, thank you, Brianna 💜. Thank you for being my friend, for all the laughter, support, and even the tough love when I needed it 💕💜🙌. You’re more than just a friend to me now—you’re like a sister 💝💜. No matter what happens, know that I’ll do my best to always have your back 💪💜, just like you’ve always had mine 🤝💜.</p>

            <img src="IMG-20240918-WA0027.jpg" alt="Celebration Image 7">
            <p>Happy birthday once again 🎂🎁🎈! Go out and shine like the star you are 💫. Today is your day 🌟, so enjoy it to the fullest! 🦵😆</p>

            <p>P.S.: I hope this letter isn’t too long 😅 (it’s giving me flashbacks to our IHS essays 😹💜) and I hope hosting a webpage was not a bit overkill 😅😅. Oh, and just a fun fact—I started working on this "Project Breezy" on the 18/09/2024. It may seem a little extra 😹💜, but I wanted it to be perfect for someone as special as you 🌚💜. And in case you’re wondering, yes, I used ChatGPT for grammar checks and embedding images 😹💜, but I wrote everything myself, plus 70% of the code 😎💯💜.</p>

                XOXO,<br>
                Grandeur 😎💯💜
